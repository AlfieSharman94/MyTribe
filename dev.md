# **Tribe Reminders**  
**Product Requirements Document**

## 1. **Overview**

**Product Name:** Tribe Reminders  
**Primary Goal:** Help users remember to reach out and stay connected with important people (their "tribe") by scheduling periodic reminders and tracking interactions.

Tribe Reminders allows users to:
1. Create and manage a list of contacts ("My Tribe").
2. Assign reminder frequencies to each contact.
3. Receive push notifications at a random time within a specified window.
4. Log interactions and notes about each contact.

## 2. **Scope**

**In-Scope Features**  
- **Contact Management:** Users can add, view, edit, and remove contacts from their "tribe."  
- **Reminder Scheduling:** Users assign a frequency, and the system randomly generates a date/time for the next reminder within the user's available "time window."  
- **Notifications & Logging:** The app displays recent notifications and collects notes on whether a user dismisses or follows through with contacting someone.  
- **Settings:** Dark mode, push notifications on/off, and configurable reminder time window.  
- **Accessibility:** The app must conform to WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility standards.  

**Out-of-Scope (for initial release)**  
- Complex social or communication integrations (e.g., direct messaging within the app).  
- Advanced analytics.  
- Web-based or desktop versions.  

## 3. **User Personas & Use Cases**

### 3.1. User Personas
1. **Busy Professional ("Alice")**  
   - Wants to maintain personal relationships despite a packed schedule.  
   - Needs quick, random reminders to call friends/family during her free time.  

2. **Stay-at-Home Parent ("Bob")**  
   - Has flexible availability but can easily forget to reach out to extended family and friends due to daily chores.  
   - Needs push notifications at a manageable frequency.

3. **Elderly User ("Carol")**  
   - May rely heavily on app notifications to maintain social connections.  
   - Needs highly accessible interface (easy to read, easy to navigate).

### 3.2. User Stories & Flows

1. **Add New Contact**  
   - *As a user*, I want to add a new contact, assign a reminder frequency, and specify how frequently I want to connect with them.  
   - *Success Criteria:* A new contact appears in "My Tribe," and a `nextReminder` is generated.

2. **Receive Reminder**  
   - *As a user*, I want to be randomly reminded within my preferred time window to contact someone in my tribe, so I don't forget.  
   - *Success Criteria:* A push notification arrives, showing the contact name and last note/action.

3. **Log Interaction**  
   - *As a user*, I want to record whether I contacted or dismissed a reminder and add optional notes.  
   - *Success Criteria:* The action and associated note are stored in the contact's history.

4. **View Contact History**  
   - *As a user*, I want to see the most recent interactions for each contact, to remind myself when and why I last reached out.  
   - *Success Criteria:* The screen shows up to 5 most recent notifications, dates, actions, and notes.

5. **Change Settings**  
   - *As a user*, I want to adjust whether push notifications are enabled, set my notification time window, and choose between light and dark mode.  
   - *Success Criteria:* The selected settings are saved and reflect in the app's behavior.

6. **Remove Contact**  
   - *As a user*, I should be able to remove a contact from my tribe if I no longer want reminders for them.  
   - *Success Criteria:* Contact is removed, and subsequent reminders for that contact stop.

## 4. **Functional Requirements**

### 4.1. Contact Management
1. **New Member Flow**  
   - Users can tap "New Member" from the "My Tribe" screen.  
   - Form includes: `Name`, `Frequency` (drop-down), and "Save."  
   - Frequencies:
     - 5 minutes (testing)
     - 1-3 days
     - 3-7 days
     - 7-14 days
     - 14-28 days
     - Every Monday
     - Every Tuesday
     - Every Wednesday
     - Every Thursday
     - Every Friday
     - Every Saturday
     - Every Sunday  

2. **Edit Contact**  
   - Tapping an existing contact shows "Contact Detail" screen:
     - Contact Name
     - Assigned Frequency
     - Last notified date
     - Next reminder date
     - Contact history (last 5 interactions)
   - "Edit" button allows changing the contact's name or frequency.

3. **Delete Contact**  
   - Ability to remove the contact entirely from the app.  
   - Confirmation prompt to ensure the user wants to delete it.

4. **Contact Storage**  
   - Stored locally in AsyncStorage under key: `contacts`.

### 4.2. Home Screen
1. **Notifications List**  
   - Shows all triggered reminders stored in local storage (AsyncStorage under `notifications`).  
   - Paginated by 5 notifications per page.  
   - Each list item shows:
     - Contact name
     - Notification date and time
     - Where you last received a notification for that contact (if applicable)
     - Last action (Contacted or Dismissed)
     - Last note
   - "Dismiss" and "Contacted" buttons for new reminders, each opening a free text field for notes.

2. **Push Notifications**  
   - If user has push turned on, they receive a native notification that leads them back to the app's Home Screen.  
   - iOS devices: prompt for push notification permissions, or direct to native Settings.

3. **Settings Cog**  
   - On the Home Screen, a cog icon leads to "Settings":
     - Toggle dark mode (uses Facebook's color scheme in both modes).
     - Toggle push notifications (redirect to native device settings on iOS).
     - Set notification time window (`startTime` / `endTime`).

### 4.3. Reminder System
1. **Reminder Frequencies**  
   - Random intervals:
     - r0: 5 minutes (for testing)  
     - r1: 1-3 days  
     - r2: 3-7 days  
     - r3: 7-14 days  
     - r4: 14-28 days  
   - Weekday-based intervals:
     - Weekly: Reminder every [day of week]
     - Fortnightly: Reminder every other [day of week]
     - Monthly: Reminder every four weeks on [day of week]

2. **Next Reminder Calculation**  
   - For random intervals:
     - Randomly selects a date within the frequency interval
     - Randomly selects a time within user's notification window
   - For weekday-based intervals:
     - Determines the next occurrence of the specified weekday
     - Adds appropriate interval (7, 14, or 28 days)
     - Randomly selects a time within user's notification window

3. **Automatic Check** (`checkForReminders`)  
   - Runs every minute and on app start.  
   - Compares current date/time with each contact's `nextReminder`.  
   - When a contact is due:
     - Generate notification object.  
     - Save to AsyncStorage under `notifications`.  
     - Update the contact's `history` (with the new "due date").

4. **Notification History**  
   - Each history entry (stored under `history_${contactId}`) includes:
     - `date`: ISO date of the notification.
     - `action`: "Contacted" or "Dismissed."
     - `notes`: Free text note from the user's input (optional).

### 4.4. Accessibility Requirements
1. **WCAG 2.0 AA Compliance**  
   - Adequate color contrast for text and UI elements.  
   - Proper labeling for interactive elements, alt text for icons (where relevant).  
   - Font sizes and spacing that accommodate accessibility guidelines.  

## 5. **Technical Requirements**

1. **Tech Stack**  
   - **React Native** for cross-platform mobile development.  
   - **AsyncStorage** for local data persistence.  
   - **Notifications** leveraging platform-specific push notification services (FCM for Android, APNs for iOS).

2. **Storage Structure** (AsyncStorage)
   ```
   {
     'contacts': Contact[],
     'notifications': Notification[],
     'history_${contactId}': HistoryEntry[],
     'notificationStartTime': string, // HH:mm
     'notificationEndTime': string // HH:mm
   }
   ```
   - **Contact** model:
     ```
     {
       id: number,
       name: string,
       frequency: string,    // e.g., r0-r4, Monday, Tuesday, etc.
       lastContacted?: string, // ISO date
       nextReminder?: string,  // ISO date
       history?: HistoryEntry[]
     }
     ```
   - **Notification** model:
     ```
     {
       id: number,
       contactId: number,
       dateCreated: string, // ISO date of when notification was generated
       reminderDate: string, // ISO date/time of the actual reminder
       ...
     }
     ```
   - **HistoryEntry** model:
     ```
     {
       date: string,    // ISO date
       action: string,  // 'Contacted' | 'Dismissed'
       notes?: string
     }
     ```

3. **Core Functions**
   - **checkForReminders()**  
     - Invoked on app start and every minute.  
     - Checks if any `nextReminder` is <= current time.  
     - If yes, generate a new Notification, store it, and update contact's history.

   - **generateNotification(contact)**  
     - Creates a notification object based on the due contact.  
     - Saves it to AsyncStorage.

   - **calculateNextReminder(contact, frequency)**  
     - Randomly selects a time within the user's `notificationStartTime`â€“`notificationEndTime`.  
     - For range frequencies, picks a random day offset (e.g., 1-3, 3-7, etc.).  
     - For day-of-week frequencies, picks the next occurrence of that day.  

   - **handleNotificationAction(notificationId, action, notes)**  
     - Updates the relevant contact's history and sets a new `nextReminder`.

   - **handleModalSubmit()**  
     - Processes user's free text notes after contact or dismiss actions.  
     - Persists to both notifications list and contact's history.

## 6. **Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Performance**  
   - The reminder check runs every minute; it must be lightweight to avoid draining battery.  
   - Pagination on the "Home" and "My Tribe" screens ensures efficient rendering of large lists.

2. **Security**  
   - Minimal user PII; only store names and app usage.  
   - Data is stored locally; no sensitive data transmissions over the network.

3. **Usability**  
   - Straightforward navigation with bottom tab bar.  
   - Consistent design across both iOS and Android.  
   - Clear calls to action (buttons labeled "Dismiss," "Contacted," etc.).

4. **Reliability & Availability**  
   - The app must gracefully handle offline scenarios.  
   - Data should persist even if user closes/reopens app.

5. **Maintainability**  
   - Organized code structure, especially in "notification" and "HomeScreen" modules.  
   - Clear separation between data handling (AsyncStorage) and UI components.

## 7. **Risks & Constraints**

1. **Push Notification Permissions**  
   - Users may ignore or decline permissions, limiting the app's functionality.  
   - Must handle fallback of local scheduling or in-app notifications.

2. **Randomization of Times**  
   - Users could find random notifications inconvenient if triggered repeatedly.  
   - Provide clear instructions on how to adjust frequency and time windows.

3. **Accessibility Implementation**  
   - Ensuring compliance with WCAG 2.0 AA might require additional time for design audits and testing.

4. **Local Storage Limits**  
   - iOS and Android have size limits for AsyncStorage. Large contact lists or long histories may impact performance.

## 8. **Milestones & Acceptance Criteria**

1. **MVP Release**  
   - **Contact Management** fully functional (Add/Edit/Delete).  
   - **Random Reminders** triggered (Frequencies, time window).  
   - **Push Notifications** for iOS/Android.  
   - **Basic Notification & Action Handling** (Dismiss, Contacted, note-taking).  
   - **WCAG 2.0 AA** interface checks.

2. **Post-MVP Enhancements**  
   - **Advanced Custom Frequencies** (e.g., user-chosen date/time intervals).  
   - **Analytics & Summaries** (weekly or monthly usage reports).  
   - **User Sharing or Cross-Device Sync** (if expanded to back-end).

## Push Notification System

### Overview

The app uses a scheduled notification system to remind users to contact people in their tribe. This document explains how notifications are generated, scheduled, and managed.

### Notification Lifecycle

### 1. Notification Creation

When a contact is created or a notification is actioned, a new notification is generated:

```typescript
// Create a new notification
const newNotification = {
  id: Date.now() + Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000), // Unique ID
  name: contact.name,
  date: nextReminderDate.toISOString(), // Future date when notification becomes due
  frequency: contact.frequency,
  lastContacted: contact.lastContacted || null,
  actioned: false,
  paused: false
};

// Store in AsyncStorage
const notificationsJson = await AsyncStorage.getItem('notifications');
const existingNotifications = notificationsJson ? JSON.parse(notificationsJson) : [];
const updatedNotifications = [...existingNotifications, newNotification];
await AsyncStorage.setItem('notifications', JSON.stringify(updatedNotifications));

// Schedule the push notification
PushNotification.localNotificationSchedule({
  channelId: 'tribe-reminders',
  title: 'Time to Connect! ðŸ‘‹',
  message: `It's time to reach out to ${contact.name}`,
  date: nextReminderDate,
  allowWhileIdle: true,
  importance: 'high',
  priority: 'high',
  userInfo: { 
    contactId: contact.id,
    notificationId: newNotification.id
  }
});
```

### 2. Storage in AsyncStorage

All notifications are stored in AsyncStorage under the 'notifications' key. The storage process should:

1. Read existing notifications
2. Check for duplicates
3. Append the new notification
4. Save back to AsyncStorage
5. Schedule the push notification
6. Emit an event to refresh the UI

```typescript
// Get existing notifications
const notificationsJson = await AsyncStorage.getItem('notifications');
const existingNotifications = notificationsJson ? JSON.parse(notificationsJson) : [];

// Check for duplicates
const isDuplicate = existingNotifications.some(n => n.id === newNotification.id);
if (!isDuplicate) {
  const updatedNotifications = [...existingNotifications, newNotification];
  await AsyncStorage.setItem('notifications', JSON.stringify(updatedNotifications));
}

// Schedule push notification
PushNotification.localNotificationSchedule({...});

// Emit event to refresh UI
DeviceEventEmitter.emit('forceRefreshNotifications', {});
```

### 3. UI Display Filtering

When displaying notifications on the home screen, we filter to show only:
- Unactioned notifications (`actioned === false`)
- Due notifications (date <= current time)

```typescript
// Filter for UI display only
const now = new Date();
const dueNotifications = allNotifications.filter(n => 
  n.actioned === false && 
  new Date(n.date) <= now
);
setNotifications(dueNotifications);
```

### 4. Actioning a Notification

When a user actions a notification:
1. The notification is marked as actioned in storage
2. A new notification is created with a future date
3. Both are saved to AsyncStorage
4. Only due notifications are shown in the UI

```typescript
// Mark notification as actioned
latestNotifications = latestNotifications.map(n => 
  n.id === id ? { ...n, actioned: true } : n
);

// Create new notification with future date
const nextReminderDate = await calculateNextReminder(notification.frequency);
const newNotification = {
  id: Date.now() + Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000),
  name: notification.name,
  date: nextReminderDate.toISOString(),
  frequency: notification.frequency,
  lastContacted: contact.lastContacted || null,
  actioned: false,
  paused: false
};

// Save both notifications
await AsyncStorage.setItem('notifications', JSON.stringify([...latestNotifications, newNotification]));
```

### 5. Important Implementation Note

The system maintains a separation between:
- What's stored (ALL notifications, including future ones)
- What's displayed (only unactioned, due notifications)

This ensures future notifications remain in storage until they become due.

### Editing a Contact

When a contact is edited:

1. The existing scheduled notification is cancelled:
   ```typescript
   PushNotification.cancelLocalNotification(String(contact.id));
   ```

2. A new next reminder date is calculated based on the updated frequency:
   ```typescript
   const nextReminder = await calculateNextReminder(editedFrequency);
   ```

3. The contact is updated in storage with the new frequency and next reminder date.

4. A new notification is scheduled for the updated next reminder date:
   ```typescript
   await scheduleLocalNotification(updatedContact);
   ```

### Deleting a Contact

When a contact is deleted:

1. The contact is removed from AsyncStorage
2. Any scheduled notifications are cancelled:
   ```typescript
   PushNotification.cancelLocalNotification(String(contact.id));
   ```
3. Any stored notifications for this contact are removed from AsyncStorage
4. The badge count is updated

### HomeScreen Display

The HomeScreen only displays notifications that:
1. Have not been actioned (`actioned === false`)
2. Have a scheduled date in the past or present (`new Date(notification.date) <= now`)

This ensures users only see reminders that are currently due.

### Clear All Functionality

The "Clear All" button processes each notification individually:
1. Marks each as actioned
2. Updates contact history with "Dismissed" action
3. Schedules the next reminder for each contact
4. Updates the badge count

### iOS Foreground Notifications

On iOS, when a notification arrives while the app is in the foreground:
1. An alert is shown with the notification content
2. The user can tap "View" to navigate to the HomeScreen
3. The notifications list is refreshed to show the new notification

### Notification Settings

Users can manage notification permissions through the device's native settings:
```typescript
const openNotificationSettings = () => {
  if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
    Linking.openURL('app-settings:');
  } else if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
    Linking.openSettings();
  }
};
```

## Badge Notification System

### Badge Count Management

Badge counts reflect due/overdue notifications that haven't been actioned:

```typescript
// Badge count calculation
const now = new Date();
const dueNotifications = notifications.filter((n: StoredNotification) => 
  n.actioned === false && 
  new Date(n.date) <= now
);
const badgeCount = dueNotifications.length;

// Update badge on both platforms
if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
  PushNotificationIOS.setApplicationIconBadgeNumber(badgeCount);
}
PushNotification.setApplicationIconBadgeNumber(badgeCount);
```

### Badge Update Triggers

The badge count is updated in multiple places to ensure accuracy:

1. **App Launch**: When the app starts, badge count is reset
2. **App Foreground**: When app comes to foreground from background
3. **Screen Focus**: When HomeScreen receives focus
4. **Notification Actions**: After any notification is actioned
5. **Clear All**: After clearing all notifications

```typescript
// App.tsx - App launch and foreground updates
useEffect(() => {
  // Reset badge count when app starts
  resetBadgeCount();
  
  // Also reset badge count when app comes to foreground
  const subscription = AppState.addEventListener('change', nextAppState => {
    if (nextAppState === 'active') {
      resetBadgeCount();
    }
  });
  
  return () => subscription.remove();
}, []);

// HomeScreen.tsx - Screen focus update
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = navigation.addListener('focus', () => {
    loadNotifications();
    resetBadgeCount();
  });
  return unsubscribe;
}, [navigation]);
```

## Notification Actions

### Clear All Notifications

When a user clears all notifications:

1. **Mark as Actioned**: All current notifications are marked as actioned
2. **Create New Notifications**: For each cleared notification, a new future notification is created
3. **Schedule Push Notifications**: System notifications are scheduled for each new reminder
4. **Update Contact History**: Each contact's history is updated with a "Dismissed" action
5. **Update Badge Count**: The badge count is reset to reflect the new state

```typescript
// Process each notification when clearing all
for (const notification of dueNotifications) {
  // Find matching contact
  const contact = contacts.find((c: Contact) => c.name === notification.name);
  
  // Calculate next reminder
  const nextReminderDate = await calculateNextReminder(notification.frequency);
  
  // Create new notification
  const newNotification = {
    id: Date.now() + Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000),
    name: notification.name,
    date: nextReminderDate.toISOString(),
    frequency: notification.frequency,
    lastContacted: contact.lastContacted || null,
    actioned: false,
    paused: false
  };
  
  // Schedule the push notification
  PushNotification.localNotificationSchedule({
    channelId: 'tribe-reminders',
    title: 'Time to Connect! ðŸ‘‹',
    message: `It's time to reach out to ${notification.name}`,
    date: nextReminderDate,
    allowWhileIdle: true,
    importance: 'high',
    priority: 'high',
  });
  
  // Update contact history
  const historyJson = await AsyncStorage.getItem(`history_${contact.id}`);
  const history = historyJson ? JSON.parse(historyJson) : [];
  history.unshift({
    date: new Date().toISOString(),
    action: 'Dismissed',
    notes: 'Cleared via Clear All'
  });
  await AsyncStorage.setItem(`history_${contact.id}`, JSON.stringify(history));
}
```
